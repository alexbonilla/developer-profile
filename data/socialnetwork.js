      description: 'What features make a song to become popular on Spotify? Is it possible to trace common parameters as a recipe for it? The dataset selected for the present work was “Spotify Tracks DB”, a collection of 228K tracks that contains audio features for each track, such as tempo, pitch, duration, danceability, energy, among others. I wanted to find which out of these features make a song become popular, and what features make a cheerful (high valence) song. The selected method was cluster analysis. It was possible to find 2 clusters out of 26 that provided a higher popularity value, as well as 3 clusters out of 26 that provided a higher valence value. The result can be used as a guide path when producing a song, to help it be played the most.'
